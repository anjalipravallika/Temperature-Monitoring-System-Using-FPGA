IMPLEMENTING A TEMPERATURE
MONITORING SYSTEM USING
VERILOG HDL :

Problem statement

Articles that describe a few accidents involving temperature
fluctuations in industries and hospitals caused many critical 
issues so they are very important to be solved, this brought us 
the basic idea for the implementation of Temperature monitoring 
system on Verilog HDL which can be done using FPGA.

Outcome

We will observe the result which is the temperature on seven segment
display connected to FPGA and control the output digits range by adjusting the inputs.
