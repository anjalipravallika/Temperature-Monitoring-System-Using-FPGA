# Temperature-Monitoring-System-Using-FPGA

IMPLEMENTING A TEMPERATURE
MONITORING SYSTEM USING
VERILOG HDL :

Problem statement

Articles which describes few accidents involving temperature
fluctuations brought the basic idea to the implementation
Temperature monitoring system on Verilog HDL.

Outcome

We will see the result which is temperature on seven segment
display connected to fpga and control it by adjusting the inputs.
